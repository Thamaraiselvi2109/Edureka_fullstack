    <h1>YOGA</h1>
    <p id="one">
      Yoga is a practice that connects the body, breath, and mind. It uses
      physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve overall
      health. Yoga was developed as a spiritual practice thousands of years ago.
      Today, most Westerners who do yoga do it for exercise or to reduce stress.

    <h1>MEDITATION</h1>
    <p id="two">
      Reduced stress: Meditation may decrease stress. It can also improve
      symptoms of stress-related conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and fibromyalgia. Improved
      memory: Better focus through regular meditation may increase memory and
      mental clarity.
    </p>
    <h1>HOMEOPATHY</h1>
    <p id="three">
      Homeopathy is an alternative medicine based on the theory of treating
      'like with like'. Homeopathy claims to stimulate healing responses to
      diseases by administering substances that mimic the symptoms of those
      diseases in healthy people. The effectiveness of homeopathic preparations
      is disputed within medical science.
